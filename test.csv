0,I just found out that I'm paying £12.75…,"I just found out that I'm paying £12.75 per month for Which against £9.99 if I subscribe today. They claim that I have some ""legal"" package which I didn't know about. Digital only is a mere £5.99 per month. I've always found a great deal of obfuscation with Which (this experience, and putting up the price without telling you) - not great from a ""Consumer Champion"" as they like to call themselves.",22 Sept 2022,Rated 3 out of 5 stars
1,Poor Which Member Services,"Totally amazed at how poor Which Member services have been. Simply wanted to change my monthly sub to an annual sub. After three attempts and assurances, it would be fixed, they are still sending me letters about an montly sub. Needless to say, I have had enough and cancelled altogether. Perhaps Which need to get their own house in order before judging others!!",21 Sept 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
2,Be careful folks,Be careful folks. I subscribed online recently and immediately saw how bad the site was. Within 1 hour of signing up I decided to exercise my 14 day right to cancel by e mailing them as required. Guess what ??? No refund or even response at all. I think this may be a scam.,19 Sept 2022,
3,When you need their help VERY DISAPPOINTING,I am a near life long member and never buy anything before reading a Which? report. Needing to buy a new mattress I consulted Which? and saw their strong recommendation for Eve. Accordingly we bought and the mattress which was delivered faulty. It is impossible to get hold off Eve's customer service department and Which? have been utterly useless in offering any help even though we only bought the mattress because of their review.,13 Sept 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
4,Seems to me Which have sold out,"Seems to me Which have sold out. The big clue for me that this is true is with their TV rankings.

Anyone following the TV space these last couple of years knows that Sony arguably make the best TVs right now, yet Which has crammed the best TV list with LG models, and Sony is nowhere to be seen.

I'm sorry, but a best TV list that's clearly giving LG favourable treatment over every other brand while leaving superior Sony TVs out in the cold, isn't a ranking list that can be trusted.

The days of Which being a source of reliable good advice that sides with the consumer are long gone. Now it appears to be just like every other product ranking site, where the highest bidder gets the top spots for advertising purposes.",6 Sept 2022,
5,£10 a month for reviews!,"In a time when people really need to save money and need to know if they can trust a product before purchasing Which want you to pay £10 a month! Use trustpilot, Amazon, Argos, Aldi, Lidl, wilko free reviews instead!!",3 Sept 2022,
6,Which endorse law breaking company,"Which are selling endorsements to a company who THEY KNOW are breaking consumer laws. I have given Which the evidence, they do not investigate the matter and continue to endorse Riviera Travel Ltd.

On this basis Which endorsements cannot be trusted, cannot be impartial and should not be relied upon.",23 Aug 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
7,"Opaque charges, deteriorating reviews","Appalled at a 'consumer organisation' being so opaque. Queried what I was paying for, prompted by notice of increased subscription and deteriorating review coverage, found out I was paying for services I'd never use as extras despite them being included in more recent, lower tariffs. Online account info doesn't tell you this. Seems to have become a collection of separate paid services for profit rather than the supportive group I first joined years ago. Complained and Cancelled subscription.",18 Aug 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
8,Unhelpful,"Whenever I call to request a magazine I find their staff very pushy and verbally aggressive in terms of sales. To actually get any useful information it costs and the free, basic packages aren't all that helpful.",12 Aug 2022,
9,Problem with Which? supplier link,"Bought a Panasonic NN-CT56JBBPQ via Which? Which? recorded the best price as £179 from VERY. Now, of course, the prices have all gone up, and VERY is no longer on their list of best price suppliers.
I'm now having difficulties with Very. The model doesn't appear to be the model I ordered and is faulty. What support/ guarantee does Which? giveunder these circumstances?",22 Jul 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
10,Prestige flowers,"Ordered flowers to be delivered and cheer a sick member of my family up.
The flowers and chocolates were delivered in a wheelie bin.
I was appalled by this. Customer service was not interested. Said they were delivered in a safe place. Apparently it’s acceptable to deliver flowers and chocolates in a wheelie bin. Seriously! More concerned now from the response I received quite honestly.",21 Jul 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
11,Which Best Buy can’t be trusted,"Brought a Bosch Series 6 washer, £900, in 2019 two and a half years later with only light use the motor has packed up.

Now Bosch want £500 to repair it because it’s past it’s two year warranty.

Why was this a “Best Buy” if it almost need replacing two years later? Can’t be trusted?

Look at Bosch’s rating on here 75% give them 1 star. Hard to see how you didn’t even do the most basic of checks.

Edit: It was faulty but no one wants to take responsibility for that both Bosch and John Lewis made us pay to have it fixed despite it being barely two years old. Seems like the CRA law is a joke that retailers can just walk around without consequences.",Updated 16 Aug 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
12,Helpful and time-saving product reviews,I've had a Which? membership for a year now since buying first house. Has saved loads of time and effort looking through reviews of products and in several cases I have bought Which? Best Buys in my price range without any further research and been extremely happy with them.,23 Jul 2022,Rated 5 out of 5 stars
13,Cancelled my membership months ago by…,"Cancelled my membership months ago by phone only to be charged, without warning, yesterday £79. Online chat now inform me Which haven't kept a record of that call (their mistake) and so they are unable to refund me.

Disgusting smug customer service agents and reliance on T&C's to steal money from people.",5 Jul 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
14,I would have given them 0 stars if I…,"I would have given them 0 stars if I could. Not a bereavement friendly company. Death in a family and would not put a pause on payments, nor block account. Demanded death certificate before this could happen, even thought it will take weeks for this to happen. Very poor customer service. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!",1 Jul 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
15,I signed up for the free one month…,I signed up for the free one month subscription and cancelled online just before the month was up but the company never implemented this and continued taking money out of my account for a further 6 months. I am very dissatisfied with this and wanted to warn others not to sign up.,23 Jun 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
16,I was going to go with Golden Charter…,I was going to go with Golden Charter for my Funeral Plan as they were very good for my wifes Funeral but WHICH recommended SAFE HANDS so I desided to go with them only to find they stole my money £3700 when I contaced WHICH they did'nt want to know I would never trust WHICH again and would recommend do your own checks and do not trust WHICH I'M 75 and just trying to make ends meet and not to leave any depts for my family but now i do not know weather i'l get anything back to pay for my funeral,30 May 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
17,Needs to get with the Real world,"Needs to get with the Real world.
With the cost of living crisis it’s time to start cutting out posts pointless monthly outgoings. £9.99 a month for what exactly? What are we even getting that’s not already out there.
2.99 every month and more people would likely subscribe meaning more money. Or do what other sites do and just have some advert income.",14 May 2022,
18,Wasted years of direct debits for zero value I'm off!,As others have said Which is massively out of date and irrelevant. I have been a member for years and only refer to it once or twice a year. Each time I get zero value from it and question why I keep paying but enough is enough. I looked for best options for refurbished mobiles and none of the top sites are included and it talks more about selling one??,13 May 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
19,Thought I'd give it a try,"Thought I'd give it a try. Did the decent thing and paid for two months.
Really disappointing though, as almost all of the reviews I found were ancient. As an example, the most recent for sunglasses was from 2011! As a minimum the old ones should be deleted and should not come up, accompanied by a which ad, on a web search.

Reply to 'Which Support' response:
You should not be relying on subscribers to point out ancient and out of date articles and reviews. There should be a process in place for filtering these out automatically.",Updated 10 Jun 2022,Rated 1 out of 5 stars
